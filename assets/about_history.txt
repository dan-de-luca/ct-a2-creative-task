# History of Paterson’s Worms:

Paterson’s Worms were inspired by the feeding behaviours of prehistoric worms observed in the sediment of ponds. Paterson and Conway were inspired by early computer simulations of fossilised worm trails produced by Raup and Seilacher in 1969. Paterson’s worms were introduced in 1973, using simple rules on triangular grids to mimic the movement patterns of prehistoric worms (Gardner, 1973)(Pegg Jr., 2003).

Cellular Automata refer to collections of cells, commonly in a grid formation (orthogonal, triangular, hexagonal, etc.), where each cell has a finite number of states, and cell states change in accordance with neighbouring cell states and a defined set of transition rules (Berto and Jacopo, 2022). Paterson’s Worms represent an interesting CA. Despite its simplicity, Paterson’s Worms exhibit complex and unpredictable patterns, making them an intriguing topic of study in the field of CA (Gardner, 1973).
