# History of Paterson’s Worms:

Paterson’s Worms were inspired by the feeding behaviours of prehistoric worms observed in the sediment of ponds. Paterson and Conway were inspired by early computer simulations of fossilised worm trails produced by Raup and Seilacher in 1969. Paterson’s worms were introduced in 1973, using simple rules on triangular grids to mimic the movement patterns of prehistoric worms (Gardner, 1973)(Pegg Jr., 2003).

Cellular Automata refer to collections of cells, commonly in a grid formation (orthogonal, triangular, hexagonal, etc.), where each cell has a finite number of states, and cell states change in accordance with neighbouring cell states and a defined set of transition rules (Berto and Jacopo, 2022). Paterson’s Worms represent an interesting CA. Despite its simplicity, Paterson’s Worms exhibit complex and unpredictable patterns, making them an intriguing topic of study in the field of CA (Gardner, 1973).

# Rules:

Conway proposed a different way of looking at worm paths, by looking at the worms as “eaters”, rather than explorers, and the lines on a grid as the food. Conway defines decision making rules as follows: Worms never take paths previously travelled, as they no longer contain food – or are at least far less likely to. Thus, the worm makes choices at each grid node based on each possible gridline having two states, eaten or uneaten (Gardner, 1973). Paterson’s Worms were originally simulated on an infinite triangular grid, moving along gridlines. Based on encountered and unencountered lines, the worm determines its direction.

# Algorithm Overview:

The algorithm operates on a two-dimensional grid, where each cell can be alive or dead. A group of worms moves independently at each time step, toggling the state of the cell they are on (alive to dead or vice versa). At each step, a worm randomly selects one of its neighbouring cells (including diagonals if simulated on an orthogonal grid), toggles its state, and moves to the selected cell. This simple rule leads to the emergence of intricate structures and behaviours, showcasing the concept of emergent behaviour in CA.
