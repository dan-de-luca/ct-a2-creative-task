## How to run: Paterson's Worms Simulation

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/dan-de-luca/ct-a2-creative-task.git`
- Install python3 and pip on your machine if not already installed.
- Install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the program with `python ./src/menu.py`
- Select Options to choose simulator configuration, OR Select Start to run simulator with defaults.

- Simulator defaults:
  - Frame Rate: 60 fps
  - Grid Size: 200 x 200 (No. cells in the simulator window. Simulator window is set to 75% of your screen height
    as both height and width.)
  - Worm Movement Pattern: Triangular
  - Track Eaten Cells: True
  - Number to Track: 10 (No. cells to track for each worm)
  - Number of Worms: 5
- NOTE: When selecting custom options, select the option then select back, select any other options, return to the start menu by selecting back, then select start to run the configured simulation.
- The simulator will then run.
- Examples below of square movement pattern, followed by triangle movement pattern.

- NOTE: The triangle movement pattern simulates behaviour closer to that simulated by Mike Paterson in 1969, along with more recent studies, compared to the square movement pattern. However, both produce interesting behaviours.
- To exit the simulator, select the X button in the top-right-corner.
